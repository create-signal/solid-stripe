Element components provide a flexible way to securely collect payment information in your Solid app.

You can mount individual Element components inside of your `Elements` tree.

```tsx
import { PaymentElement } from 'solid-stripe'

function CheckoutForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <PaymentElement />
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```
