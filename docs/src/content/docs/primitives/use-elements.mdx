To safely pass the payment information collected by the Payment Element to the Stripe API, access the Elements instance so that you can use it with [stripe.confirmPayment](https://stripe.com/docs/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment).

```tsx
import { PaymentElement, useStripe, useStripeElements } from 'solid-stripe'

export default function CheckoutForm() {
  const stripe = useStripe()
  const elements = useStripeElements()

  async function handleSubmit(event) {
    // We don't want to let default form submission happen here,
    // which would refresh the page.
    event.preventDefault();

    const result = await stripe().confirmPayment({
      // `Elements` instance that was used to create the Payment Element
      elements: elements(),
      confirmParams: {
        return_url: 'https://example.com/order/123/complete,
      },
    })

    if (result.error) {
      // Show error to your customer (for example, payment details incomplete)
      console.log(result.error.message);
    } else {
      // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment
      // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate
      // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.
    }
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <PaymentElement />
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```
